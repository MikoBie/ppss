Because they are usually the most practical, easy to implement, and straightforward to understand.

When I was showing you the Heron algorithm we skipped a very important assumption we made. We agreed, even though without really saying it, that we will be good with an approximation of the solution. You probably remember from high school that $\\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number. This means that there is no way to precisely represent its value as a finite string of digits (or as a `float`). The decision (not to mix it with [The Decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decision_(TV_program))) to approximate the results is a very strong assumption that actually allows us to solve this problem, otherwise, we would not be able to do so. And as I mentioned before in programming languages we very often are good with an approximation of the answer.\n",

Instead of an overcomplicated algorithm we are just going to check wether our guess is the right answer. If not we will add a small number to our guess and test the answer again.
