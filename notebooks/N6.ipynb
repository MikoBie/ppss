    "What we just saw was [JSON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4QDxoWlPFw) format that is commonly used online. When next semester we will be finally using some real data it will be most likely in this format. We will avoid using any kind of tabular data in _Python_ not because it is impossible but because for our purposes most of the time _R_ is better suited for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In _Python_ a natural representation of `JSON` is a dictionary (often also refered as mapping). Any hashable object can be used as a key, for example, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, but also a function or tuple. However, for now we are going to use mostly strings or integers. In a way dictionary is similar to a list except that we index them using **keys** rather than integers. You can think about them as key-value pairs. Similarly to `JSONs` they are enclosed between curly braces and each element is written as a key followed by a colon followed by a value. For example, consider the code below."
