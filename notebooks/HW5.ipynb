    "## Task 1. (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a real-world case of my failed experiment. A couple of weeks ago I prepared an online experiment that was meant to assess participants' working memory. The procedure followed the dual-task paradigm. That means that it required participants to perform two tasks simultaneously. On the one hand, they were displayed with strings of letters and asked to memorize them and afterward recall them in the correct order. On the other hand, before every single letter was displayed they had to solve an easy mathematical equation. Therefore, the task had the following scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve an equation\n",
    "2. Memorize a letter\n",
    "3. Solve an equation\n",
    "4. Memorize a letter\n",
    "5. Recall letters in the correct orders\n",
    "\n",
    "If a participant succeeded in recalling letters in the correct order they moved to the next level in which there were three letters to memorize and later recall. If they failed twice in the row in recalling letters in the correct order the task was finished. To make sure that participants understand the procedure before running the main task they had a chance to practice each part. Therefore, first, they practiced recalling letters without solving equations -- simple recall. Second, solving the equations. Third, the whole procedure. Finally, after the practice came to the main task -- complex recall. Unfortunately, it turned out that I made a mistake in displaying letters. My program drew a letter from the list looking like the one below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "letters_to_display = ['X', 'V', 'Q', 'F', 'H', 'G', 'B', 'L', 'J', 'M', 'P', 'D', 'K', 'C', 'T', 'S', 'W', 'R', 'N', 'Z\\n']\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is clear from the first glance that the last letter `Z` has something glued to it. `\\n` is a symbol of a new line. It was invisible for participants when displayed but when someone recalled correctly `Z` my program tested it negative, i.e.\n",

    "This is quite a big issue, right? Yes and no. Actually, it is only a big issue if a participant recalled the letters correctly but the procedure evaluated them as wrong. For example, this would not be an issue.\n",

    "pariticpant_input = ['XZR']\n",
    "displayed_letters = ['XZ\\nQ']\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "That is because the participant anyway recalled the letters wrong. Moreover, it is the issue only if my mistake lead to the end of the procedure. For example, this would be an issue.\n",
