    "The notebook at the end of the day is just a list of cells (chunks) with either text or executable code and its output. To enter the input mode and type in code or text into a cell you need to simply click on the cell. However, you do not need to use the mouse. There are quite a few extremely useful shortcuts that allow navigating through the document using almost only the keyboard (you will learn fast that it is what you want to do most of the time). \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to remember that there are two modes: `input` and `navigate` mode. While the former is quite obvious because it is used to type, the latter allows moving between cells. In the navigate mode, you can move between cells using arrow keys. To enter the input mode press `enter`, and you will be able to type in something. On the other hand, you can leave the input mode without executing the cell by simply pressing `esc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before entering the cell it is good to know what you will write inside, whether it will be code or text. Therefore, press `m` to write plain text and `y` to write the code (obviously you need to be in the navigate mode otherwise you will just type either m or r). The default input is code.\n",

Bellow, there are a few useful tips on how to use Jupyter Notebook effectively:\n",
    "- use arrows `up` and `down` to navigate\n",

    "- use `a` when in the navigation mode to add a cell above the current cell\n",
    "- use `b` when in the navigation mode to add a cell below the current cell\n",
    "- use `c` when in the navigation mode to copy the current cell\n",
    "- use `v` when in the navigation mode to paste the cell below the current cell\n",

    "In a nutshell (and simplifying a bit) programming is an art of communicating with a machine that is super efficient in performing simple logical and arithmetical operations as well as storing the results but beyond that, it is extremely dumb (for amusement check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN2RM-CHkuI) video what would happen if people followed the instructions as computers do). Hence, it is crucial to be **perfectly** explicit. Otherwise, the machine will not understand, or even worse, misunderstand our intentions without telling us, which may lead to results that are seemingly ok but inherently wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when we are trying to communicate with a computer we use instructions that it can understand. In computer science and maths, they are usually called algorithms. They describe a set of computations that when executed on a set of inputs will proceed through a sequence of well-defined states and eventually produce an output. You can think of an algorithm like a recipe from [Jamie's Oliver cookbook](https://www.jamieoliver.com/features/how-to-cook-pasta-in-6-easy-steps/):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fill a large saucepan with water, put the lid on, and bring to a boil over high heat.\n",
    "2. Add a good pinch of sea salt.\n",
    "3. Once the water is boiling, stir in the pasta.\n",
    "4. Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions. To tell if your pasta is cooked, try a piece about a minute or so before the end of the cooking time. It’s ready when it’s soft enough to eat, but still has a bit of bite. The Italians say ‘al dente’.\n",
    "5. Scoop out a mugful of the starchy cooking water and set it aside. This will help emulsify the pasta sauce.\n",
    "6. Drain the pasta in a colander over the sink. Now it’s ready to toss through your favorite sauce -- it’s best to do this in the pan, adding splashes of cooking water and mixing as you go until your sauce coats the pasta and is a perfect consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or more in the mathematical way like Heron of Alexandria who allegedly was the first to document a way to compute the square root of a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a guess, $g$.\n",
    "2. If $g\\times g$ is close enough to $x$, stop and say that $g$ is the answer.\n",
    "3. Otherwise create a new guess by averaging $g$ and $x/g$, i.e. $\\frac{(g + x/g)}{2}$.\n",
    "4. Using this new guess, which we again call $g$, repeat the process until $g \\times g$ is close enough to $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there is no such concept as the best programming language because if you can do something in one programming language you can do it also in another (all modern programming languages are [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness). However, different languages are better or worse for different kinds of applications. You have already learned a bit of _R_ and it is perfect for statistics analysis. I would also say it is good for data wrangling and data manipulation on a small scale but I would not recommend it for big data or any of the purposes I mentioned before. Similarly, neither _R_ nor _Python_  is very good for websites creation. It is doable but there are better languages for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, likewise every other programming language, has a set of primitive constructs, syntax, static semantics, and semantics. Therefore, in this regards it is similar to natural languages, e.g. in English the primitive constructs are words, the syntax describes which strings of words constitute well-formed sentences, the static semantics defines which sentences are meaningful, and the semantics defines the meaning of those sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, typically in English, when you want to form a sentence you can not really throw five nouns like: [Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV](https://youtu.be/tRjGHHYe9nA?t=24). To create a syntactically valid sentence you need to have some other parts of speech than just nouns. In Python it is similar. The sentence of primitives $3.2 + 3.2$ is correct but $3.2\\ 3.2$ is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The static semantics defines which syntactically valid strings have a meaning. For example, in English, you can not just write 'I runs 5km every day'. It is incorrect (check in Grammarly if you do not believe me). Although syntactically everything works in terms of regular verbs declination there is an issue here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The semantics of a language associates a meaning with each syntactically correct string of symbols that has no static semantic errors. In other words, what action the program should perform. In programming languages, each correct sentence (program) has exactly one meaning, unlike in natural languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are the most common. You should be prepared for getting a lot of them. It is going to be a bit frustrating but soon enough you will learn first how to read error messages and second how to avoid syntax errors. The more dangerous and harder to avoid are semantic errors. That is because _Python_ like any other programming language can not read in your mind. If there are no syntax and static semantic errors the program has a meaning. However, sometimes the meaning of the program is different than you would expect because you made a mistake in designing it.\n"

    "\n",
    "The second, important observation is that the result is an approximation. The correct result should be $2\\frac{1}{3}$ not $2.3333333333333335$. That is because of how _Python_ and other programming languages represent floating-point numbers. Under the hood, they are written as base 2 (binary) fractions. It means that for example $.125$ is represented by $\\frac{0}{2} + \\frac{0}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}$. In the case of $\\frac{1}{3}$, it is impossible to find a base 2 fraction that would represent it precisely. What is more, it is impossible to write in base 2 fractions $.1$ precisely. The closest approximation is $\\frac{3602879701896397}{2^{55}}$ which equals to $.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625$. This problem is known in all modern programming languages as [Represenation problem](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html).

Moreover, there are ways in _Python_ to perform more precise calculations but we will not need them here.\n",
