That is because method `OneD.remove('Zayn Malik')` muttates the list `OneD` and in `BBands` we don't have a new list that contains elements of `OneD` but rather reference to `OneD`. Therefore, whenever we change `OneD` it will have an effect on `BBands` as well but not on `BBands1`. In _Python_ the fact that there are mor than one path to the same object is called aliasing. One path goes through variable `OneD` and the second through first element of the list `BBands`. We can mutate the object via either path, and the effect of the mutation will be visisble throgh both paths.\n",

We wanted to mutate the list `TrzyHa` so it contains only one name -- `Jacek Graniewski` but we failed miserably. Why is so? That is because during a `for loop` (no matter that we are iterating over elements) _Python_ uses an internal counter that is incremented at the end of each iteration. When the value of the counter reaches **the current length of the list**, the loop terminates. It is quite simple, right? However, when the list is mutated on the fly strange things happen. Let's examine what happened in our example iteration after iteration. At the beginign our lists look like the one below.\n",
