That is because method `OneD.remove('Zayn Malik')` muttates the list `OneD` and in `BBands` we don't have a new list that contains elements of `OneD` but rather reference to it. Therefore, whenever we change `OneD` it will have an effect on `BBands` as well. In _Python_ it is called aliasing. This means that there are more than one path to the same object. One path is through variable `OneD` and the second through first element of the list `BBands`. We can mutate the object via either path, and the effect of the mutation will be visisble throgh both paths."
