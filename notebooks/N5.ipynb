Therefore, whenever we change `OneD` it will affect `BBands` as well but not on `BBands1`. In _Python_ the fact that there is more than one path to the same object is called aliasing.

That is because during a `for loop` (no matter that we are iterating over elements) _Python_ uses an internal counter that is incremented at the end of each iteration. When the value of the counter reaches **the current length of the list**, the loop terminates. It is quite simple, right? However, when the list is mutated on the fly strange things happen. Let's examine what happened in our example iteration after iteration. In the beginning, our list looked like the one below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![list-0](png/list-0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the first iteration the internal counter was `0`. Under index `0` we have `Jacek Graniewski`. We examined if `Jacek Graniewski` is present also in the second list but since he is not we increment the counter. The list `TrzyHa` has not changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![list-0](png/list-0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the second iteration the internal counter was `1`. Under index `1` we have `Michał Witak`. We examine if he is present also in the second list. He is so we remove it from `TrzyHa` list and increment the counter. The list `TrzyHa` now looks like the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "![list-1](png/list-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the third iteration the internal counter is `2`. Under index `2` now we have `Sebastian Imbirowicz`. We examine if he is present also in the second list. He is so we remove him from `TrzyHa` list and increment the counter. The list `TrzyHa` now looks like the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "![list-2](png/list-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The counter reaches the current length of the list and terminates the `for-loop` and we end up with not what we expected. To avoid this kind of problem we should have iterated over the copy of the `TrzyHa` list. Easier said than done, right? Because we know that if we wrote the following it would not solve the issue, right?"
